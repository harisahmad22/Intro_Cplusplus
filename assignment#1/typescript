---------------------
PROBLEM #1
==========
Polya's Specific Techniques:
----------------------------
Observation 1 - Restate the problem in your own words
Observation 2 - Simplify the problem (eliminate irrelevant detail)
Observation 3 - Represent the problem (symbols)
Observation 4 - Classify the problem
Observation 5 - Classify the problem



PROBLEM #2
==========
(i) 1 input value
    A finite sequence of 0 or more integer values.
(ii) 2 output values
     The two outputted values are integers.
(iii) This algorithm determines whether or not the integer inputted is divisible
      by 2 or 7 (and not 2) with no remainder and then prints out both counts.
      


PROBLEM #3
==========
Step #1
----------
Acute-equilateral - All side length's must be equal
	    	  - All internal angles must be equal
Acute-isosceles - Any two of the three side length's must be equal
		- No sole internal angle is greater than 90 degrees
Acute-scalene - None of the side length's are the same
	      - None sole interanl angle is greater than 90 degrees

Obtuse-isosceles - Ant two of the three side length's must be equal
		 - One of the three internal angles is greater than 90 degrees
Obtuse-scalene - None of the three side length's are equal
	       - One of the three internal angles is greater than 90 degrees

Right isosceles - Any two of the three side length's must be equal
      		- One of the three internal angles must equal exactly 90 degrees
Right scalene - None of the three side length's are equal
      	      - One of the three interal angles must equal exactly 90 degrees

Step #2
----------
Set triangle = "unspecified"

read largest_angle
read leftside
read rightside
read bottomside

if largest_angle is < 90
   if leftside = rightside = bottomside
   then
	set triangle = "acute-equilateral"
   if leftside = rightside or leftside = bottomside or rightside = bottomside
   then
	set triangle = "acute-isosceles"
   otheriwse
	set triangle = "acute-scalene"

if largest_angle is > 90
   if leftside = rightside or leftside = bottomside or rightside = bottomside
   then
	set triangle = "obtuse-isosceles"
   otherwise
	set triangle = "obtuse-scalene"

otherwise
   if leftside = rightside or leftside = bottomside or rightside = bottomside
        set triangle = "right-isosceles"
   otherwise
	set triangle = "right-scalene"

write triangle



PROBLEM #4
==========
set num_courses = 0 
set total_credits = 0
set total_grade_points = 0
set GPA = 0.0

read num_courses_taken
read course_grade_points
read course_credit_hours

for each course in num_courses_taken
    set num_courses = num_courses + 1
        repeat until all courses in num_courses_taken have been read

    total_grade_points = course_grade_points x course_credit_hours
        repeat until end line of course_grade_points and course_credit_hours
	has been read

    for each course in course_credit_hours in total_credits
        set total_credits = course_credit_hours + course_credit_hours
            repeat until end line of course_credit_hours has been read

if num_courses_taken = 0
then
    write "undefined GPA"

otherwise set GPA = (total_grade_points / total_credits)
    write GPA
